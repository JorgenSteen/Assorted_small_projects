This Sub-repository contains models and codes to make a LED-matrix.

Currently there is only a model for a 5x5 matrix.

I have made the model in sketch-up and the file to edit it is there. 
But the .stl file is also there ready to be open and sliced by your favorite slicer.

The code is are basic patterns based on cpldcpu's light ws2812 library.[test]( https://github.com/cpldcpu/light_ws2812)
