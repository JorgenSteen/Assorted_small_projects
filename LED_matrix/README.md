This Sub-repository contains models and codes to make a LED-matrix.

Currently there is only a model for a 5x5 matrix.

I have made the model in sketch-up and the file to edit it is there. 
But the .stl file is also there ready to be open and sliced by your favorite slicer.

The code uses [cpldcpu's light ws2812 AVR library]( https://github.com/cpldcpu/light_ws2812).
It is a good library which makes it possible to adress the LED-strip from any pin.

I have made on code with basic patterns and soon there will be a more complex code with remote adressing later on.
